				<h3>Pronounce References</h3>
                <p>Looking for Pronoun References and Specific Information is a skill in reading or understanding a text that involves identifying pronouns in the text and looking for specific information to which the pronouns refer. When we read a text, the author often uses pronouns such as "he," "she," "they," or "it" to refer to people, things, or concepts that have been mentioned earlier in the text. To understand the text well, it is important to be able to identify the exact reference of the pronoun and look for the specific information that the pronoun refers to in the context of the text. This helps us to connect the information and understand the relationship between different parts of the text.</p>
                <p></p>
				<h3>Transition Quetion</h3>
                <p>Transition questions are a type of question used to move from one topic or idea to another in a conversation or discussion. They help create a logical flow and connection between different parts of the conversation. Transition questions are commonly used when switching from one subtopic to another or when shifting the focus or direction of a conversation. These questions serve as a bridge between different ideas, allowing for smooth transitions and ensuring that the conversation remains cohesive. These questions can be used to introduce a new topic, summarize information, clarify a point, or invite others to share thoughts or opinions. Overall, transition questions play an important role in maintaining a coherent and engaging conversation.</p>
                <p></p>
				<h3>Implied Detail Quetion</h3>
                <p>Implied detail questions are a type of question that focuses on uncovering implied or implicit information that is not explicitly stated in the text or passage. These questions seek to identify the meaning or message behind the given information. Implied details are indirect clues or references that require the reader to make inferences or draw conclusions based on the information available.</p>

				<p>Examples of implied detail questions are:</p>

				<p>What can you infer about the characters' feelings based on their actions in the story?</p>
				<p>What can you infer about the relationship between the two characters based on their dialogue?</p>
				<p>How does the author subtly convey the theme of the story without explicitly stating it?</p>
				<p>What underlying message is the author trying to convey through the symbolism used in the text?</p>
				<p>Based on the character's actions, what can you deduce about their motivations?</p>
				<p>What does the author imply about the future of the protagonist at the end of the story?</p>
				<p>How does the setting contribute to the overall mood or atmosphere of the narrative?</p>
                <p></p>
